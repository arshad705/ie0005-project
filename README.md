# Overview
This project explores the relationship between music listening habits and mental well-being using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors such as listening duration, BPM (tempo), genre preferences, and mental health indicators (e.g., anxiety, depression, insomnia), we build predictive models to determine whether music has a positive (Improve) or negative (Worsen) impact on individuals.

Using supervised learning algorithms like Random Forest and Decision Tree, as well as unsupervised clustering methods, we identify key features that influence music's effect on mood and mental health.

# Technologies Used
1) Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn)
2) Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn for model training and evaluation)
3) Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn for EDA and decision tree visualization)
4) Jupyter Notebook (for interactive data analysis)
